				I'm a computer science major at <span class="ucla">UCLA</span>. I'm in Japan as of March 2021, where I am doing an
				internship for KPMG Ignition Tokyo. In my spare time I like to study Japanese, try new food, and work on my personal
				worldbuilding projects.

					<h3><span class="shock">3M</span></h3>
					<p>
						I worked for 3M over the summer of 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). The job was supposed to be in Atlanta,
						but I ended up working remotely from my childhood home in SoCal. At 3M my main task was to take hospital
						performance data stored in SQL databases and transform it into easily-digestible powerpoint presentations for
						3M clients.

					<h3><span class="shock">Symantec</span></h3>
					<p>
						I worked for Symantec over the summer of 2019 in Culver City, CA. My main accomplishments were the creation of
						a chat bot hosted on the internal company slack. This bot made it possible for slack members to query various
						internal and external APIs on the legitimacy of URLs, email addresses, phone numbers and more. Symantec is a
						security company so this is a very useful tool to have. Additionally, I did some exploration on how to detect
						and prevent web skimming, the injection of malicious JavaScript into e-commerce websites to steal credit card information.
