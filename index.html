				I'm a Cupertino High School senior, and soon I'll begin studying computer science
				at the <span class="ucla">University of California, Los Angeles</span>. During
				High School I was part of the <a href="http://tinohacks.tech/">TinoHacks</a> Hackathon team,
				and we successfuly hosted two overnight high-school student hackathons at 42 USA.
				I also program web apps and hope to explore machine learning over the course of this year.
				Furthermore, I build solar systems, draw maps, and even make languages.</p>

						It is intended to help faciltate meetups.

						LocatoBot was programmed in JavaScript, using the Google Places API
						as well as the GupShup bot platform.

					TinoHacks is an entirely high-school student-run overnight hackathon. I was
					involved with it during its first two years, as part of the Sponsorship Team.
					We managed to host the hackathon at 42 Silicon Valley in Fremont, CA for two
					consecutive years. The first year we had 150+ attendees to which we distributed
					$19,200 worth of prizes.
