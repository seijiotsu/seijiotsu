				I'm a computer science major at <span class="ucla">UCLA</span>. During high school, I was
				part of the <a href="http://tinohacks.tech/">TinoHacks</a> Hackathon team, where I took part
				in organizing two overnight high-school student hackathons at 42 USA in Fremont, CA. My current
				CS project is developing a website called <a href="https://makeplanets.com">Make Planets</a>, an
				application to help science fiction authors and worldbuilding enthusiasts design realistic planetary
				systems. In my spare time, I also like drawing maps, designing languages, and exploring Los Angeles with
				my friends.

					<p>
						<b>Make Planets</b> is a website that gives science fiction authors a comprehensive toolbelt to
						design their own unique and realisitc planetary systems. Users can check the stability of their systems
						and edit it on the fly, see the sizes of planets and moons in each others skies, quickly design
						orbital resonances between sibling planets and moons, and so much more. Afterwards, the custom
						star systems can be exported to 3rd-party programs such
						as <a href="http://spaceengine.org/">SpaceEngine</a> to view it in immersive 3D.
					</p>
					<p>
						Make Planets was built using the MEAN stack, running on Angular 6.

					LocatoBot averages the location of all participants in a Telegram

					It is intended to help faciltate meetups.

					LocatoBot was programmed in JavaScript, using the Google Places API
					as well as the GupShup bot platform.

					<p>
					TinoHacks is an entirely high-school student-run overnight hackathon. I was
					involved with it during its first two years, as part of the Sponsorship Team.
					We managed to host the hackathon at 42 Silicon Valley in Fremont, CA for two
					consecutive years. The first year we had 150+ attendees to which we distributed
					$19,200 worth of prizes.
